## Drum Machine

- improvements / questions:
    - SCSS - I'm relying on calc() to do heavy lifting for component sizes
        - is this scalable? who do I exclude?
        - is there a better way or do I need to make peace with tradeoffs?

- react context for app level constants?
    - e.g. power state?

- Styling
    - animations. e.g. display fadeout animation? where?
    - button click on keypresses
    - power button glow and colours / power down indication on other components

- Sound Board Selector
    - use icons for selectors (on/off like power button)
        - use SVG icons? means custom class and not a library? but fa doesn't do cowbells...

## Markdown Previewer 

- Improvements:
    - clean reducer function
        - move default initial state to store creation and work with sensible defaults
        - move business logic (functionality) to separate files or area (logic/business/functions folder?)
