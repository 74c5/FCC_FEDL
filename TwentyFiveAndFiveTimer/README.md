# 25 and 5 timer - Project 5

[Demo](https://74c5.github.io/demos/FEDL/TwentyFiveAndFiveTimer/)

Project 5 of freecodecamp.org 'Front End Developement Libraries' course. 

The project goal of the project is utilise several front end libraries (and interdependencies) to implement a clone (ish) of https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/wgGVVX.

This time around we're going to have a bit of a play with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

Libraries used:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
    - with [React](https://reactjs.org) included
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org) (for global state)
- ... and all their associated dependencies

## Lessons Learned / Observations

There was a fair bit of jiggery pokery to get next.js and redux to play nicely. I don't really need an accurate rendering on the server side.

There are some design decisions that I would not take, if the rubrik did not force me to. E.g. settings would be hidden in a Modal (nulled when not shown).

Final Rubrik test will not pass, because the test does not include a delay between button press and checking playback has stopped/reset. My implementation uses the app state (redux) to determine whether the audio should be played and/or reset. Redux and react updates are asynchronous, so the test case is excuting to completion before my app has completed reacting to the button press.

I lumped a lot more functionality than together than usual. This was to try out reducing the number of files (since the project was quite simple). i.e. There are no controller elements and all of the logic is contained in the store (of which there is only one). This is starting to get unwieldy, but made things easier at the start. Going forward, I think I may start more simply, and refactor to more modules as complexity is added. There is also a fair bit of (non-ideal) jank here - e.g. position and definition of 'timerUpdateCallback' feels like a circular reference, and can only be defined where 'store' is in scope.

I should probably investigate architectures other than MVC.

## Creation Notes

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It was then stripped back to a simple app, .

Manual setting of path in `next.config.js` is for html export deployment to github pages. Remove these options for Vercel deployment.

## Available Scripts

- `npm init && npm install`
    - installs all dependencies and setup up project directory
- `npm run dev`
    - Runs the app in the development mode.
    - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
    - The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
    - You will also see any lint errors in the console.
- `npm build`
    - Builds the static app for production to the `out` folder. Using `next build` and `next export`
    - It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
    - The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
    - Your app is ready to be deployed!
- `npm start`
    - starts a server, for testing the static production build.
- Installing vercel server - `npm i -g serve` - allows serving of exported site locally using `serve out`.

- To learn more about nextjs, see [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).
- To learn more about React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
- To learn more a about redux see [their documentation](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/usage/usage-guide).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
