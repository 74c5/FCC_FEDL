Directory of Front End Developement Library Projects for freecodecamp.org curriculum.

## Introduction

My personal aim for these projects is to get a feel for the (setup and) use of Front End Developement Libraries; Along the way working out issues  and interdependencies between the various frameworks.
A secondary concern is coming to grips with a workable build system.
Though not unimportant in real world projects, overall look and design of these projects is only a tertiary priority; with precidence given to completing the challenges expediciously. :-)
