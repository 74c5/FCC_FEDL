## Random Quote Machine - Project 1

Deliberately fast and nasty - i.e. a prototype system.
No (minimal) buildling or build tools (which made some things more difficult).
The idea was to concentrate on only the core components.

This means the code base is it's a bit sloppy and fragmented - lots of files and a bit slow - but also easy to pick apart straight from the browser.

Used stack:
- React
- Redux ?
- fontawesome
- googlefonts -?
