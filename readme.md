Directory of Front End Developement Library Projects for freecodecamp.org curriculum.


## Introduction

The aim of these projects it to practice the use and setup of Developement Libraries and work out issues with interdependencies.
A secondary concern is coming to grips with a workable build system.
Though not unimportant in real world projects, overall look and design of any presentation of sites takes tertiary priority, with precidence given to the above concerns and completing the challenges expediciously. :-)

## Random Quote Machine - Project 1

https://74c5.github.io/FCC_FrontEndDevelopmentLibraries/RandomQuoteMachine/snapshot/

Deliberately fast and nasty - i.e. a prototype system.
No (minimal) buildling or build tools (which made some things more difficult).
The idea was to concentrate on only the core components.

This means the code base is it's a bit sloppy and fragmented - lots of files and a bit slow - but also easy to pick apart straight from the browser.

Used stack:
- React
- Redux ?
- fontawesome
- googlefonts -?
