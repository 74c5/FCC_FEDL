Libraries used:
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org) (for global state)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) (Javascript based)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
- ... and all their associated dependencies


Quotes used API is 'http://quotes.stormconsultancy.co.uk/random.json'

## Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

It then stripped back to a simple app, with SASS and bootstrap support added.

A template project can be found in ../template

## Available Scripts

- `npm init && npm install`
    - installs all dependencies and setup up project directory
- `npm start`
    - Runs the app in the development mode.
    - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
    - The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
    - You will also see any lint errors in the console.
- `npm test` (not currently used)
    - Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
- `npm run build`
    - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
    - It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
    - The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
    - Your app is ready to be deployed!
    - See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
